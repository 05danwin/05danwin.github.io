      The capybara is a semi-aquatic rodent native to southern- and central
      america. They are closely related to guinea pigs and rock cavies, and more
      distantly related to chinchillas and agouti. Like beavers, capybaras are
      strong swimmers. Their pig-shaped bodies are adapted for life in bodies of
      water found in forests and wetlands.

    <p id="högerkolumn">
      Their toes are partially webbed for paddling around, and their reddish to
      dark brown fur is long and brittle—perfect for drying out quickly on land.
      Small eyes, noses, and hairless ears are located high on their heads so
      that their faces remain exposed and alert when most of their body is
      submerged. Being alert is important when you’re often dinner for jaguars,
      pumas, and, in the water, caimans. Capybara young have even more to worry
      about—they are a favorite snack food of snakes like the boa constrictor,
      crab-eating foxes, small cats, and birds of prey like the caracara and
      black vulture.
